# Master-s-Thesis-Results
This repository contains the results from Sandra Helweg SÃ¸rensen's and Jonas Benjamin Rose Aldous's Master's thesis, that was conducted from September 1st 2023 to June 3rd 2024. The results for some of the data found within this repository are based on data from the Critical Path for Alzheimer's Disease (CPAD). The repository does not include any data from CPAD directly, but covariance matrices, mean trajectories, and different figures are based on the data found in the CPAD database.

## Simulation Study (nlme vs. lmer)
This folder includes a written chapter about the non-proofread findings of the simulation study. This includes what was observed when the distribution of the errors and random effects were changed, as well as comments about some general tendencies. Besides the written chapter, all produced figures can be found for the different simulation (600/25, 60/6, 150/25), where the first number refers to the number of subjects, and the second number refers to the number of visits.

## Simulation Study (PMRMs vs. cLDA model)
The folders herein are divided into how many subjects are in each arm (300, 500, and 1000). The results of the respective simulation scenarios are found in these folders. The subfolders for these include the results gathered from the simulated data, the true effects from the optimisation algorithm for each model in each simulation, tables for the statistical power, and more.

### General results
Besides the folder for each population size, there is a folder which contains tables with additional information and plots of the effect estimates themselves in the "no effect" scenario for 300, 500, and 1000 subjects in each arm.

## Subgroup Analysis
The folders herein are divided into how many subjects are in each arm (300, 500, and 1000). The results of the respective simulation scenarios are found in these folders. The subfolders for these include the results gathered from the simulated data, the true effects from the optimisation algorithm for each model in each simulation, tables for the statistical power, and more.
